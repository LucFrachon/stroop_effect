Project 1 of the Coursera Data Science Specialization. Run a simple statistical test to find evidence of the Stroop effect

The Stroop effect is a well know phenomenon in psychology (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect)).
We are given data from the experiments and we run a statistical test to assess whether we can confidently reject the null hypothesis (ie., confidently say that the effect is real and not observed by chance).
